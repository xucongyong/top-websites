# What is motivation


* The motivation is the desire to complete a specific behavior (eat spinach at night) or a certain type of behavior (eat vegetables and other healthy foods every night).
* Some psychologists advocate distinguish between external motivation and internal motivation. I definitely have no intention of offending these psychologists, but I found that this is a very weak distinction, which is not very useful in the real world.

I focus on three motivation sources: you (what you want), you want to take the benefits or punishment that can be obtained by taking action (carrot increases), and your surrounding environment. In order to help you understand this more intuitively, I created a character image called "PAC villain" (as shown in Figure 2-1). You will find that it always emerges suddenly. It turns out that characters, action, and contests are the basis for understanding human behavior. "


## What is PAC

* Person Person: People who take action
* Action ACTION: Financial actions obtain external interests or punishment
* Context Context: motivation caused by the environment where the characters are located


"It can be seen from the figure that the motivation can originate from any of these three factors. First of all, the motivation can be derived from a person's inner: you want to do this behavior. For example, many people want to make themselves more Attractive, this is the inherent motivation of humans.
Such as taxation. The first thing most people wake up every day is not to pay taxes, but not paying taxes will be punished, which gives us the motivation to pay taxes. Finally, motivation can also originate from the situation (the environment we are currently). Suppose you are participating in a charity auction, which is a very valuable thing. Many people are drinking, and the auctioneer has cooked the atmosphere. All of this is the situation (carefully designed), which prompts you to take pictures The motivation of the auction. "


* Five reasons that have motivation cannot be achieved
* The motivation is complicated
* After the motivation rushes to the peak, it will fall quickly
* Motivation fluctuations are very frequent
* The use of motivation to chase abstract concepts cannot produce results
* It cannot achieve long -term changes by motivation alone


## Clarify the desire and list the behavior cluster

* Step of behavioral design
* Clear wish
* Explore behavior options
* Matching specific behavior for yourself


* How to win the motivation monkey
* Wish list.

### Clarify the differences between the three aspirations, Outcom, and Behavior.

* Wish: or the results you want to get. "Wishes are abstract desires, such as" I want children to succeed in school ";
* Achievements: It is easier to measure, such as "the achievement of" excellent "in the second semester. Wish and achievements can be used as the starting point of action, but they are not behavior.
* Behavior is what you can do now or at a specific moment. For example, turn off your phone, eat a carrot, and open a book to read a few pages. These are the actions you can take at any time.
* Unable to achieve wishes or achievements. For example, you cannot suddenly change the quality of sleep, and you cannot lose a few pounds of fat after today's dinner. Only by adhering to the correct specific behavior can you realize your wishes and achieve results.

 "Objective", the semantics of this word is not clear enough. Using "wish" or "results" will be clearer.

* I want to reduce the time to watch TV.
* I want to improve the quality of sleep!
* I want to lose 12%body fat.
* I want to be more patient with my son.
* I want to improve efficiency.

The above is a wish, not action.

### Traversing behavior options

* Traversing positive and negative feedback behavior: come out of all behaviors to achieve the target

* Determine desire: Use learning to replace playing games
* Explore behavior options:
* Positive behavior
* Full, sleep enough
* Open the book
* Draw the Fogg Behavior model diagram
* Positive feedback record
* Find a list with the largest negative child weight
* Making behavior list
* Describe the motivation of wish
* Establish a reward list
* Prepare fruit and dark chocolate
* Negative behavior:
* Delete the game
* Watch the film
* Recommended system
* WeChat
* cell phone

# Prompt prompt

HOOK behavior on the existing reminder,

## Person Prompt character reminder:

The physical instinct is the most natural character tip. The body will remind us to make an instinct response,

* Example:
* For example, you are hungry, sleepy, and want to go to the toilet.
* Brush AKI when eating


## Context Prompt Reminder

Anything in the surrounding environment is OK

* As a prompt for action: convenient stickers, app notifications, telephone ringtones, reminding you of colleagues who attend the meeting.

Situation prompts are sometimes useful, but it may also bring pressure. Management prompts are a major challenge facing people in modern life.

There is a large white board in my study, which lists many projects to be organized. Different projects have different color marks. In order to manage the visual and psychological pressure it brought by it, I covered the things that I didn't need to do with a piece of cloth, and only revealed the prompts that needed to be done on the same day. I found that the reminder to cover other things can make me calm and more focused. If the situation you set is not effective, it may not be because you do something wrong, or lack motivation or willpower. Please don't blame yourself. You only need to redesign the prompt to find a hint for you.
